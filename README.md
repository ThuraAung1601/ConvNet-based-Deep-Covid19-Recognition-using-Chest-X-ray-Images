# Covid-19 Recognition using Chest X-ray Images
ConvNet based Deep Covid-19 Recognition using Chest X-ray Images

## Introduction

## Dataset
A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. This COVID-19, normal, and other lung infection dataset is released in stages.
